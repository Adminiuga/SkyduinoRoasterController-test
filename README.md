# Skyduino Roaster

## What is this?

This is a "pre-alpha" firwmare sources for Skyduino Roaster, a [custom Arduino board](https://github.com/Skyduino/Skyduino-Hardware/) for Skywalker/ITOP MTCR(SkItop) roaster.

## Why is this even here?
This project was inspired by the [original work](https://github.com/jmoore52/SkywalkerRoaster) of Josh Moore, who reversed engineered the Skywalker roaster protocol and built a sketch for connecting the roaster and [Artisan](https://artisan-scope.org/) allowing either full control of the roaster or just the data logging.
Also, I wanted to learn something new and building Arduino boards, with a display and a TC interface required too much soldering, so there always was an idea of building a custom Arduino board which had everything required for this roaster onboard.
